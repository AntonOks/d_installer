The install script now runs on Windows

The D installation script (install.sh, available at
$(LINK2 https://dlang.org/install.sh, dlang.org/install.sh))
now supports POSIX-like environments on Windows.
This allows installing and using Windows versions of DMD, LDC, and Dub
from e.g. CygWin or MSys2, thus providing a unified way of installing
D compilers across supported platforms.
