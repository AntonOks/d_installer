\cf0 DMD is the reference compiler for the D programming Language. The front end of DMD is released under The GNU General Public License.\
\
D is a systems programming language. Its focus is on combining the power and high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern languages like Ruby and Python. Special attention is given to the needs of quality assurance, documentation, management, portability and reliability.\
\
The D language is statically typed and compiles directly to machine code. It's multiparadigm, supporting many programming styles: imperative, object oriented, and metaprogramming. It's a member of the C syntax family, and its appearance is very similar to that of C++.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\qc

\i0 \cf0 The compiler is installed under /Library/D/dmd/ and symbolic links are created to /usr/local.
